## (Optional) Update the Theme

1. In the tab that your app is running in, there will be a grey toolbar at the bottom of the page. This is your development toolbar that allows you to edit regions in your application user interface (UI) directly in the tab it's running in.  
*Note: If you do not see the grey developer toolbar, mouse over the bottom of your browser window to make it display. End users who log directly into the app will not see this toolbar.*

2. In the dev toolbar, click on **Customize** and then click **Theme Roller**.

4. Under the **Theme** section, click on the Select Theme select box and choose **Redwood Light**.

5. Under **Redwood Options** section, Layout select **Contained** then press **Save As** and provide your desired **Style Name**.
