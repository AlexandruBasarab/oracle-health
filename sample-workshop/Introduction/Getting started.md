# Introduction

Organizations today are challenged with analyzing large amounts of structured and unstructured data such as tables, invoices, reports for compliance reporting to regulatory authorities accurately.This requires analyzing, filtering and summarizing large volume of textual and tabular data that are typically resident in an enterprise lakehouse, on-premise servers and cloud. Producing outputs accurately and timely that conforms to a form template is a big time and effort consuming task and hence enterprises are looking to Artificial Intelligence to solve this issue.

## About this Workshop

So, in this hands-on lab, we will show how you can auto-generate and fill up compliance forms summarizing information from a pool of  PDF documents to submit to regulatory authorities. This lab uses OCI Generative AI tool sets to generate custom content from a healthcare organization clinical trial dataset. 

To maintain generic nature of the lab and data compliance, all source clinical trial data is auto-generated by OCI Generative AI model such as Cohere Command R+

Learn more about the architecture, methodology and the key automation steps that can be adopted to scale compliance document generation across your enterprise knowledge base.

Estimated Workshop Time: -- 60 minutes

### Objectives



In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Use OCI Generative AI, OCI DataScience and vector embedding processes
* Embedding and loading data into a vector store like OCI Opensearch
* Implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Interface
* Effective prompting to generate query outputs from OCI Gen AI LLM
* Using a pre-canned template to generate a compliance form

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Basic familiarity with OCI Generative AI Services and Tool sets
* Some familiarity with Python programming language.
* Basic understanding of large language models (LLM)
* Some familiarity with OCI Opensearch service
* Some familiarity with open source langchain framework
* Familiarity with clinical trial and compliance submission process would be helpful but not required
