# Introduction

## Workshop Overview

Welcome to the Oracle LiveLabs Workshop: Building an ASCVD Risk Calculator! In this hands-on session, we will guide you through the process of creating a powerful application using Oracle Application Express (APEX) and FHIR APIs. By the end of this workshop, you will have a fully functional ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) Risk Calculator at your disposal.

Estimated Time: 2 hours

### During this workshop, we will cover the following steps:

* Introduction: We will provide an overview of the workshop's objectives, discuss the importance of ASCVD risk assessment, and explain the tools and technologies we'll be using.
* Signing up for an APEX Workspace: Before we dive into application development, we'll walk you through the process of signing up for an APEX workspace, which will serve as your development environment for building the ASCVD Risk Calculator.
* APEX Application Setup: Once you have your APEX workspace ready, we'll guide you in setting up a new application. We'll explore the application builder, create the necessary database objects, and establish the foundation for our ASCVD Risk Calculator.
* Signing up for Code Console: The Code Console is a web-based application that allows third-party developers to register applications and consume Oracle's FHIR APIs. We'll show you how to sign up for Code Console and integrate it with your APEX workspace for enhanced development capabilities.
* Creating an ASCVD Risk Calculator: In this main section of the workshop, we'll guide you step-by-step through building the ASCVD Risk Calculator application. You'll learn how to design the user interface, implement the necessary logic and calculations, and customize the application to meet your specific requirements.
