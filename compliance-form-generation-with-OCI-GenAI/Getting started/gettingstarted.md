# Introduction

OCI Generative AI and associated tools provide a scalable and flexible automation framework for Compliance form generation and related use-cases. Though this workshop do not reflect an actual regulatory authority form, but the principles outlined here can be effectively used for this purpose.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Use OCI Generative AI, OCI DataScience and vector embedding processes
* Embedding and loading data into a vector store like OCI Opensearch
* Implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Interface
* Effective prompting to generate query outputs from OCI Gen AI LLM
* Using a pre-canned template to generate a compliance form

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Basic familiarity with Generative AI concepts, RAG and Industry
* Some familiarity with OCI Generative AI Services and Tool sets
* Familiarity with Python programming language.
* Basic understanding of large language models (LLM)
* Some familiarity with OCI Opensearch service
* Some familiarity with open source langchain framework
* Familiarity with clinical trial and compliance submission process would be helpful but not required
